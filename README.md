## Database Design

The system uses three main tables:

### users

Stores application users and roles.

```text
id
username
password_hash
role
created_at
```

### books

```text
id
isbn
title
author
genre
publication_year
total_copies
available_copies
added_by
created_at
updated_at
```

### loans

Stores book borrowing records.

```text
id
book_id
user_id
loaned_at
due_date
returned_at
status
```

## Layered Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

```text
Frontend UI
    ↓
Flask Routes
    ↓
Authentication and Role Middleware
    ↓
Model/Data Access Layer
    ↓
SQLite Database
```

This separation keeps the code clean, testable, and easier to maintain.
